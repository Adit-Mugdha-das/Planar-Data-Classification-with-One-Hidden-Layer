# Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer

The assignment involves building a shallow neural network with one hidden layer to classify non-linearly separable 2D data using NumPy from scratch.  
This repository contains my implementation of the Week 3 programming assignment from the **Deep Learning Specialization** (Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning) by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this assignment, I implemented a neural network architecture from scratch, including both forward and backward propagation, to classify a planar dataset. This model shows how adding non-linearity through activation functions in hidden layers allows for solving problems logistic regression cannot.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Shallow neural networks with one hidden layer
- tanh and sigmoid activation functions
- Binary classification vs non-linear boundaries
- Vectorized implementation of forward and backward propagation
- Cost function and parameter optimization with gradient descent
- Decision boundary visualization

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

##  Files

- `planar_data_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete assignment
- `testCases.py`: Helper script for testing your functions
- `planar_utils.py`: Utility functions for data handling and visualization
- `datasets/`: Contains the 2D classification dataset
